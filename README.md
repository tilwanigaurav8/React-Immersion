# BeachVille

My first ReactJS project which has ebeen developed for VITB students and Placement Admins to eliminate and add students into Immersion Program.

## Features

1) User authentication for adding/eliminating students as same page is viewed by VITB
2) By clicking on student card, we get the domain detail of the student
